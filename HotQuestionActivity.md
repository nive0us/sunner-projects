# Introduction #_

The first moodle activity for physical classroom. The idea comes from Purdue University's [hotseat](http://www.itap.purdue.edu/tlt/hotseat/).

In or out of classroom, students post questions into Hot Question activity from notebook, netbook, android, iPhone, iPod Touch and other gears which can access the moodle site. Students can also vote on others' questions, so that the hottest questions will be popped up. Teachers can make orally comments on selected questions in classroom.
